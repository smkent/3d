This height is called the Z offset, which is the difference between the printer's detected baseline height when leveling and the correctly calibrated printing height.</p> <p>If the nozzle is too high, the printed object won't stick to the bed. If the nozzle is too low, the lower parts of the printed object will be squashed or bumped over by the nozzle as it moves.</p> <p>The Leveling menu on the LCD will display the current Z offset value, along with controls to increase (raise) and decrease (lower) the Z offset by 0.05 or 0.01 millimeters. The goal is to set the nozzle height to approximately 0.2 millimeters higher than the bed.
