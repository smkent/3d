# Finding and using models

## Where to find models

There are several popular web sites used to publish models. Many, if not most,
models on these sites are available for free under [Creative
Commons][creative-commons] licenses.

* :simple-printables: [**Printables**][printables] by Prusa.
  [This is where I publish models I've made or remixed][printables-profile].
* :simple-thingiverse: [**Thingiverse**][thingiverse] by Ultimaker. Thingiverse
  has been around longer than many other sites and has a wide selection of
  models.
* :simple-thangs: [**Thangs**][thangs], with models both on their own site and
  search results from Printables, Thingiverse, and other sites
* :simple-yeggi: [**Yeggi**][yeggi], a model search aggregator with search results
  from Printables, Thingiverse, and other sites

## Licensing and permissions

When a creator publishes a 3D model, they choose a **license** which describes
what other people are allowed to do with that model.

Free models published on the above sites are nearly always published under
permissive **open source** licenses. These are usually
[Creative Commons][creative-commons] licenses or sometimes open source software
licenses such as the [GNU General Public License][wiki-gnu-gpl].

!!! info

    Usually you can download and print a model for yourself with no
    restrictions. Most models require you to give the creator credit if you
    re-share or modify the model, and some creators do not allow people to print
    and sell copies of their models without permission.
