# Welcome!

Several months after getting my 3D printer, I'm introducing others to the world
of 3D printing! This guide is an introduction to 3D printing with the same
printer I have, the [Sovol SV06 Plus][sovol-sv06-plus].

Feedback, suggestions, and [pull requests][repo-url] are welcome.

## About 3D printing

I've found 3D printing to be a fun, useful, and educational hobby! 3D printing
provides learning opportunities around materials, software, electronics, math,
and more.

3D printing requires attention and patience, but the results are well worth it!

In just the first months of owning my 3D printer, I've made all sorts of things:

* Figures and toys (for humans and cats)
* Drawers and organizers for my desk and office
* Hardware, tools, and accessories for woodworking, such as custom router
  templates
* Replacement parts for furniture and fixtures around the house
* Gifts for family and friends

I've even started learning 3D modeling and
[creating my own printable models][printables-profile]!
I've really enjoyed modeling a thing, and then printing and seeing it in real
form.
