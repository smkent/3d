## Heat bed cable support

The heat bed cable on the Sovol SV06 Plus normally hangs behind the printer
frame. This two-piece model adds support to the heat bed cable to reduce strain
and help it fit into a smaller space.

## Dual spools with better grip

These are two models that pair well to make changing and using filament spools
easier on the SV06 Plus. The dual spool holder makes it easy to queue up a
second spool when changing filaments. The improved spool holder model grips
filament spools by the center for smoother rotation compared to the stock spool
holder.

!!! note

    These models are not compatible with the default filament runout sensor
    mount on the SV06 Plus. However, the filament runout sensor can be relocated
    to the extruder using another model or omitted entirely if desired.

    I find I don't use the sensor most of the time. Usually I am printing small
    models where it's obvious there is enough filament on the spool. The SV06
    Plus prints normally with the filament runout sensor unplugged.

## Filament runout sensor extruder mount

The filament runout sensor can be mounted on the extruder just over the filament
inlet. This reduces the amount of wasted filament at the end of a spool. With
some minor wiring adjustment, the sensor can also be connected right to the side
port on the extruder so the separate wiring harness to the mainboard box is not
needed.
