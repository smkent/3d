    !!! note
        Some replacement parts for the SV06 Plus are also available from other
        stores such as Amazon and AliExpress. Prices vary and one store is not
        always the cheapest. Some parts on the SV06 Plus can also be substituted
        with generic replacements.

  lots of specific information for the Sovol SV06 and SV06 Plus

    !!! info
        The Teching Tech web site has some features which offer to generate
        G-code. G-code varies from one printer to another and I recommend only
        running G-code created by your slicer.
