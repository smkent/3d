# Getting Started

I've found 3D printing to be a fun, useful, and educational hobby! 3D printing
provides learning opportunities around materials, software, electronics, math,
and more.

3D printing requires attention and patience, but the results are well worth it!

In just the first months of owning my 3D printer, I made all sorts of things:

* Figures and toys (for humans and cats)
* Drawers and organizers for my desk and office
* Hardware, tools, and accessories for woodworking, such as custom router
  templates
* Replacement parts for furniture and fixtures around the house
* Gifts for family and friends

I've even started learning 3D modeling and

I've really enjoyed modeling a thing, and then printing and seeing it in real

This **Getting Started** guide will walk you through setting up the Sovol SV06
Plus 3D printer and printing your first model!

## About the Sovol SV06 Plus

I selected the [Sovol SV06 Plus][sovol-sv06-plus] for a handful of reasons:

* It has an all-metal hotend which supports a wide variety of materials
* The build area is large at 300 x 300 x 340 millimeters
  (300 millimeters is about a foot)
* It's an open source clone of the popular
  [Prusa MK3S+ 3D printer][prusa-mk3s+]. This has a number of benefits from
  repairability to software compatibility and community support.
* It's more affordably priced than alternatives with its feature set
