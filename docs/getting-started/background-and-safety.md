## How does 3D printing work?

3D printing can refer to a number of technologies. The most popular technology,
and the one this guide is about, is called
[Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) or Fused Filament Fabrication (FFF)][wiki-fff].

This type of printer works by heating up a plastic filament until it melts, and
then pushing ("extruding") that filament out of a nozzle in a controlled
fashion. At the same time, a computer controls motors that move the nozzle and
build base ("print bed") around so the plastic is placed ("deposited") in
precise locations. Together, this turns the plastic into a precise shape one
layer at a time.

## Safety

It's important to know how to use a 3D printer safely, like any other tool. 3D
printing involves high temperatures and moving parts.

### Heat safety

* Both the nozzle, where the plastic is extruded, get very hot while printing.
  Don't touch it when it's hot. If something goes wrong with a print, stop the
  printer and wait for the nozzle to cool.
* Similarly, the print bed also gets very warm while printing. Depending on the
  printing material, the print bed ranges from very warm to hot. Don't touch the
  print bed while printing.

### Electrical safety

* Check the power and bed cables periodically for wear.
* Ensure the cables and wires are plugged in snugly, and don't get squashed
  while the various parts of the printer are moving.

### Safety for moving parts

* Don't put your fingers or hands near the print bed while it is moving. If the
  print bed moves unexpectedly, your fingers or hand could get stuck between the
  bed and the frame.

### Materials safety

* 3D printing process emits VOCs, which can vary by material used and printing
  temperature. The best permanent home for a 3D printer is a ventilated space or
  enclosure. (Building an enclosure can be a fun side project!)

### General safety

* Make sure the printer is on a stable surface with enough space for the print
  bed to move all the way forward and backward.
* Periodically check the printer while it is printing, in case the printer needs
  to be stopped. It is normal for some prints to fail. When this happens, the
  printer will continue extruding plastic which creates a spaghetti ball of
  filament.
* Keep the printer clean!
