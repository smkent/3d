# Assembling the Sovol SV06 Plus

The SV06 Plus comes mostly pre-assembled except for the various body parts.
Pages 3-12 of the [user manual][sovol-sv06-plus-user-manual] describe how to
assemble the printer. Assembly largely involves:

* Attaching the gantry (vertical assembly) to the horizontal base assembly
* Attaching the extruder, power supply, mainboard, and LCD components
* Connecting the wiring harnesses to the power supply, extruder, motors, and LCD

Sovol has
[an assembly tutorial video][sovol-sv06-plus-unboxing-assembly]:

!!! info

    After assembling the printer, check the voltage selector on the power
    supply. Mine was set to 230V out of the box. Change the selector to 115V for
    use in the US.
